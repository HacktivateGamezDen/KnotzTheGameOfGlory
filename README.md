## About

"The Game of Glory" is an action-packed adventure where players must navigate through various obstacles, battling enemies and collecting rewards along the way. The game incorporates elements of real-time action, strategy, and platform gaming, resulting in an enthralling gaming experience.

The game offers a plethora of features such as different enemy types (Ground, Climbing, and Flying), floating messages, collisions, and exciting visual effects (particles). The aim of the game is to rack up the highest score before the time runs out. But be careful! You only have three lives, so every decision matters!
